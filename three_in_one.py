# 3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

# First thoughts: Ok this question was really confusing at first, but I understand now.
# Using one array to implement three stacks, I would split the array into three separate sections.
# Assuming the array is length some multiple of 3 and is non-zero
# there'd be some n/3 which determines the sizes of each of the stacks.
